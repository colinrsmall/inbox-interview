# inbox-interview PRD

## Overview, Mission, and Opportunity

**Overview:** Inbox Interview is a web app that delivers daily, tailored interview questions straight to a user's inbox—based on their chosen topics or a specific job posting—along with instant grading and constructive feedback.

**Mission:** This project primarily serves as a demonstration of building and maintaining software in public, as well as a personal portfolio piece. To no small extent, I hope this project can also help at least one person who stumbles across it land their next career move.

**Opportunity:**: Many joob seekers already turn to LLMs as virtual career and job interview coaches. This project formalizes and structures this concept, embedding interview practice seamlessly into a user’s daily routine by delivering questions directly to their inbox. Checking and responding to emails is a component of many peoples' daily routines and offers a low-friction opportunity to practice interview questions on a daily basis. This daily-practice-question paradigm is common for standardized testing practice, reinforcing learning through consistent, manageable engagement.

## User Personas

**Persona 1:** College Student -- A college student is a user who balancing coursework with the need to prepare for job interviews—whether for internships or entry-level positions. They are likely preparing for job interviews several months in advance, and are likely to use the software either year-round or in a seasonal bursts for several years, looking for yearly summer internships and, eventually, a entry-level position post-graduation.

**Persona 2:** Unemployed Prepper -- An unemployed prepper is a user who is actively searching, and possibly already interviewing, for a job while unemployed. They are more likely to be looking for a non-entry-level and non-internship position than college students, and are more likely to use the app more often (that is, request multiple interview questions per day) than users of the other personas. They are likely to use the app intensively for a short period—typically two to three months.

**Persona 3:** Window Shopper -- A window shopper is a user who is either passively searching for their next posiition or generally looking to stay in good interview shape. Window Shoppers are likely to use the app once or twice a week over a period of 6 or more months.

In all cases, a user of the application is likely to be techncially knowledgeable and likely to be searching for a positions that require similarly technical interviews, such as software engineering, data science, product management, or project management. Other users may be non-technical but will still be searching for positions that require a competitive "technical" interview, such as positions in biotech/life sciences or finance.
